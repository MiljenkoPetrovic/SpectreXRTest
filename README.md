# SpectreTest
This is GitHub repo for spectre employee test. Here are your tasks:

### Menu Scene
- Simple scrollable menu with more than one field - though only one field needs to actually work.
- Select the proper menu field to load the next level.

### Main Scene
- Make a simple WASD + mouse camera controller.
- In this scene you will find four rotating cubes. Do the following:
 - Make a look trigger. When the player is looking at the cube, the cube needs to stop rotating. When the player looks away, the cube continues to rotate as before.
 - Make a radial trigger. When the player gets within one meter of the cube, the cube should disappear. When the player walks away from the cube, it reappears. Bonus points if you make this without triggers or colliders.
